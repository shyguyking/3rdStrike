            Third strike is home to a plethora of characters, both new and old to the Street Fighter franchise. With only four returning characters from previous installments in the series, Street Fighter III attempts to meld together previous character archetypes while introducing new ones to the table. Each character in the game in some way, shape, or form stands out from their peers in the way they can be played. Even within the constraints of a single character, any one player can express themselves differently from another because of the depth of not only the characters, but the game mechanics themselves. Here can be found a brief summary of each individual character, as well as notable players who use them. Note that tiers are loosely ordered but HIGHLY debatable, so take this into consideration when viewing the list.

            In her most notorious incarnation, Chun-Li is a defensive beast. She mainly relies on punishing opponents with her high speed and range, solid power and 2nd Super Art which can be combo'd into multiple ways. Her game plan remains very simple when contrasted with the rest of the cast; build meter and throw out nasty pokes that hit confirm into her powerful super. Any bad guess can lead to the end of the round against the monster that is Chun Li.

His game is heavily reliant on having good neutral.  So the better the neutral game translates to more meter.  More meter means more Genei Jin.  More genei jin = High chance of hitting your opponent.</q> <br>- acslayer, top level North American Yun player <!-- technically, I'm quoting a discord message here, but you can clearly see the use of both the "q" element and "cite" attributes to provide context for the quote -->
          </p>
          <p>
            This analysis of Yun can not be any more apt! Without meter, the character is looking to get meter, and with meter, he is only looking to build more for the next time. Yun's genei jin super is thought to be the best in the game due to how it transforms the character into an offensive powerhouse unable to be dealt with lightly.

            Makoto is very unique, and still is to this day, as the first female fighting game character to be fairly slow and hard-hitting with just as much stamina as the average males (like Ryu and Ken), whereas all other female fighters before her had always focused on speed and always had notably less. Although her normal walk speed is incredibly sluggish, she probably has the best dash in the game, as well as high priority and several mixups off a knockdown. Her best tool however is the Karakusa, a very unique command grab which can be comboed off of, making way for devastating damage and, overall, a highly dangerous and frustrating offensive fighting style. Not to mention her touch of death combos she can pull out against most of the cast, effectively narrowing down her gameplan to a single correct guess.

            Ken Masters, the second most famous and played fighting game character, needs little introduction. His best incarnation for most was in 3rd Strike, the only game where more people play him than Ryu. He is one of the best characters in the game, mainly for his highly effective offense on top of his normal Shoto capabilities. Having near perfect option coverage on offense as well as a strong, fast super that allows you to set up and confirm that offense at any given point in the match.

            Dudley is a quick, strong, high-precision character with various juggles, strong mixups and lockdown capability, as well as multiple different anti-airs. As a king of rushdown, his main problem is his difficulty dealing with strong offense himself. A character with an abundance of 50/50 mixups forcing the opponent to guess at every interaction, Dudley is no slouch at starting his offense and pushing it forward unlike most of the cast.

            Yang is sick. Only real ones play Yang. Why? He's the lesser brother of Yun who's main function is that of the rekka character. With his easily hit-confirmable string of slashes and divekick pressure, Yang players can set off a flurry of offense at a moments notice. His choice of super art only compounds the pressure moreso. With the option of super art 2, Yang has access to a much faster and more powerful rekka that deals a great deal of stun damage to the opponent. His super art 3 on the other hand, gives him extremely safe poking options which at worst leave him neutral on parry, allowing him to continually push his offense until the super has completed its use.

            Urien is a character that relies mostly on setups, basic mixups and normal moves. His basic game is extremely straightforward and his attacks aren't that unique, but his sum is greater than it's parts, mostly thanks to Aegis Reflector. If you can deal with extreme meter dependency in return for the ability to make a knockdown or corner trap akin to slaughter, Urien is your man.

            When playing Akuma, the basic goal is either to use his zoning ability to control your opponent’s options, minimizing the risk of getting hit yourself, or to simply go on total offense and decimate the opponent as quickly as possible, as they can take him out just about as quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very important to note (if you didn't know already) that Akuma has the absolute worst defense rating of all the characters in 3S, and is tied with Remy for having the smallest stun bar. One should also note that Akuma's supers are all the same length, and that he has no EX moves. All this was done to counter balance his incredible offense and mixups.

            The original street fighter, returning once again to brawl around the world. In third strike, Ryu fits the standard build for the shoto character, much like Ken and Akuma. He does great stun and impressive damage, and with his supers all having good utility and damage potential he is able to make his openings count. His strong EX moves give him a lot of tools to play with in any given matchup. As well as two fairly straight forward supers, Ryu has access to an unblockable fireball super, the Denjin Hadouken, that must be parried and deals incredible stun damage to give him a unique playstyle if the player wants to go that route. Ryu will force you to play his game when in the hands of a strong player.

            Oro is a charge character that excels in looping his opponents and dealing high burst damage. Oro is the only character with a double jump, and this can allow for unique neutral applications as well as unblockable attacks. He struggles to make use of parries from far range, but up close can end a round very quickly with his launching standing MP. Oro tends to build meter only when comboing and struggles to do so outside of combos, and needs a lot of meter for his best combos. It takes a lot of knowledge to play Oro at a competent level, as all his attacks have very specific, niche uses.

            Blanka and Dhalsim fusion anyone? Necro is a stun damage monster with many overhead attacks and lots of tricky pressure. He also has some very long range normals that cover large portions of the screen. The character's gameplan revolves around pushing his opponents to the corner and exerting his pressure there, stunning his opponent for the win. Necro makes use of his many safe attacks and strong throw baits to force his opponent into respecting his offense.

            Ibuki is your typical high school senior with one minor catch, she's a practiced ninja. Ibuki utilizes her many multi-hit strings and strong mobility to confuse and outwit her opponents. Ibuki does not deal high damage, but has great ways to open her opponents up in return. She can best be described as a momentum character; once she starts her offense, it can be hard to stop her from getting her way. She has the unique ability to dash through opponents furthering her mix-up game by keeping the opponent guessing. Her super of choice is her air kunai super, which is safe on block and deals unholy amounts of chip damage to any opponent.

            Elena is a Capoeira fighter with a lot of work put into her sprite design. Her artwork and fighting style is based around flow of movement and freedom. She struggles to perform classic combos, but has many long range overhead and low options. She controls cornered opponents exceptionally well, relentlessly pelting them with her long limbs. Her EX Spin Scythe is your go to combo tool in every scenario, launching for followups. Elena can be summed up as a lesser Chun Li, where she can get big damage off of long range pokes albeit to a far lesser extent.

            Can you play Guile? Can you do Tiger Shot mixups? Yes? Well, learn how to parry and you're a Remy player. It also doesn't hurt to be French. While the zoning archetype doesn't work well in the third strike engine due to the prominence of the parry mechanic, Remy does have some solid strengths to work with. He will keep you at bay with his Lights of Virtue and hit you out of the air with his Rising Rage Flash. He's a monster up close, with a Cold Blue Kick that lets him stay on top of you and the ability to make you block for days. A tough character for sure, but definitely deadly in the right hands.

            Alex, who hails from New York, is the main character in the Street Fighter III series. His appearance slightly mimics that of professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. He wears green overalls, brown combat boots and an identifying red headband.
          </p>

            As the new main character of Street Fighter at the time, Alex was created to be another well-rounded character like Ryu and Ken, but also original from the Shoto archetype. As such, he is a semi-grappler who is both strong and decently swift, has good health and can rack up a lot of stun very quickly, with a breadth of various and unique tools to work with. While he may not have many combos or offensive mixups, in the right hands, he can bring down his opponents quicker than anyone else in the game.

            Hugo is 3rd Strike's most straightforward grappler, moreso than Alex, and as such, requires exceptional patience to play. He can do a highly impressive amount of damage with only a few moves (theoretically capable of KOing Chun-Li with only 4 uses of his main command grab, the Moonsault Press), but getting within range is certainly not easy. Hugo is also the largest character in 3rd Strike, meaning he has a big set of hitboxes, which other characters can use to easily hit-confirm many combos and Super Arts. He is also the slowest among them, so most of the time, blocking a move from the opponent doesn't automatically mean you have the opportunity to counteract with a combo or command grab, like other characters can do, such as Chun-Li. So it's easy to say that Hugo’s punishing game off of blocks isn't all that strong.

            Perhaps the most popular of the low tiers, Q is a fairly simplistic brute-force brawler with good power, range and many useful normals, but he is also fairly slow, meaning every move must be deliberate. Additionally, he has the highest potential stamina in the game if the player finds safe times to taunt, making him very difficult to kill at that point. All this being said, Q lacks basic tools that most of the cast shares to make a complete, well-rounded character. While he has some very good aspects such as a long-reaching, high-damage command grab, he leaves much to be desired. Having only 2 cancelable normals to make use of, a Q player must be wary of when and how they convert damage from an opening. But if done correctly, a Q player can upset even the best of players.

            Sean is perhaps the most efficient definition of an underrated character in the history of fighting games. In the 2nd version of Street Fighter III, 2nd Impact, he was pretty much totally broken, doing tons of damage off of his lengthy combo strings. In response to this, Capcom did the responsible thing and made him an original character, as opposed to a black Ken in a yellow gi.

            Well, they did it a little too well.

          <p>
            Other than being extremely hard to use and situational because of his hit-box placement and frame advantage (Dragon Smash's hit-box is located over his head), 3s makes Sean much more of a defensive counter character. When you play as him you have to understand that he does have a lot of good points, such as his MP-HK target combo, Cl.HK/Shoto normals, EX Tornado, and his supers. He trades pretty well if used properly with the right SA's against the right match-ups.

            And people say Sean is the worst character. Well, to be perfectly fair, Twelve is actually quite fun to play as, until you realize that you're doing no damage and are almost dead.
