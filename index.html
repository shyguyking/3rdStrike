          <h3>Unique Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay of third strike is unparalleled in all of the fighting game genre. It serves to revolutionize what can and can not be done in a one on one fighter due to the complexity of the characters, mechanics, and systems set in place by the game. All of these seemingly simple mechanics at face value combine together to form the advanced metagame that is third strike. No one option in this game has any set respone. The sky is the limit when it comes to the myriads of situations that the game may put the player into at a split-seconds notice. This variability in gameplay is what sets third strike's inherent gameplay apart from the rest.
