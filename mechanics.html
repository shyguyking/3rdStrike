            The main draw point to any fighting game player to their preferred fighting game is usually that of the game mechanics. This is something that Third Strike has in abundance. As well as popularizing many mainstays of modern day fighting games such as the dash ability, a dedicated grab input, a universal overhead, and ex moves, Street Fighter III: Third Strike introduces it's own unique flavor to the experience of the player. These core mechanics to the gameplay can provide a unique experience to every player who picks up the game; they introduce a level of personal expression which will let players of all skill sets and levels find enjoyment.

          <h3>Super Arts</h3>
          <p>

            The Street Fighter III franchise takes advantage of a super meter system, where upon gaining enough meter by using or getting hit by attacks, allows the player to unleash a super attack. What this game does differently however, is it gives each player the option to select one of three super arts per character. Any two players can be playing the same character, but the super of choice may differ between each player making their experiences unique.

            This can clearly be seen in Ryu's super choices. His first super choice, the Shinkuu Hadouken, is a straightforward fireball super. It has two medium sized bars of meter that can also be used on his EX moves. His second super choice, the Shin Shoryuken, is a high damage uppercut. It has one long meter to compensate for the huge damage output that comes with it and can be confirmed into much like his previous super. His third super choice, the Denjin Hadouken, is far less straightforward than his previous two. This super is stocked with only one medium sized bar and is a chargeable fireball. Upon release, Ryu unleashes an unblockable projectile that must be parried or else the opponent takes a massive blow to their health and stun guages.

            With the choice of these three super arts, Ryu can play wildly different based on which he chooses to select. This is also true with the rest of the cast, albeit to different extents. Some super arts are what define a character, such as Urien's Aegis Reflector or Yun's Genei Jin. But the basic concept of having that freedom of choice to select which super is right for you introduces a level of creativity rarely seen in fighting games.

          <h3>Personal Actions</h3>

            </figure>
            Let's discuss the idea of taunting in fighting games. In most games in the genre, the ability to taunt only serves a single purpose, to get in the head of your opponent. This is commonly referred to as salt. This however, does not come with any explicit benefit, as the effects of salt are all mental. In third strike however, a character's taunt, or personal action, provides additional benefits to the user. This can vary anywhere from a buff in damage output, stun damage, or a projectile attack even. Most well-known is that of the character Q. With his personal action, Q increases his defensive power upon striking a terrifying pose. This effect can be stacked up to three times per round which can give the opponent a very hard time actually knocking out the Q player.

          <h3>The Parry System</h3>
          <p>
            <figure class="flowRight">
              <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/bd8d4cc7-f080-4bd2-a9ab-85ba0b51e852%2Ftumblr_d9592f19ebe10e569e45e08e70e0c32c_a4aa86aa_250.gif?v=1601496710496" alt="Parry example">

            Here it is. The make or break mechanic of Street Fighter III: Third Strike. This is the one central mechanic that defines whether or not third strike is the game for you: parries. This mechanic gives a slight frame advantage to the defender and leaves the opponent open for a counterattack. Against high/mid/air attacks, a forward tap will input a successful parry. Against a low attack, a down tap will input a successful parry. This can even be done midair, allowing for further control by the defender.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what is it about this mechanic that truly represents Third Strike as its own game? This defensive mechanic essentially makes various traditional fighting game ideas obsolete. The zoning archetype, for example, takes a major hit by the introduction of parries. Whereas in other games, a defender has to watch out for a fireball and time their approach options accordingly, the ability to parry lets the defender safely deal with the fireball and gain some super meter in return. The idea of absolute anti-air options such as shoryukens also take a massive hit. While in other titles, an uppercut will cleanly beat an aerial opponent 100% of the time, the opponent can simply parry the anti-air attempt and start an even more devastating punish. Setplay as an idea completely crumbles under this system, because any habit can be snuffed out by a smart player finding the right opportunity to parry.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is what makes the game so beloved among its community. There is no absolute right or wrong answer in any situation in third strike. <q>There is no always and there is no never in 3s.</q> Variation is the name of the game here. While some things may be arguably stronger in specific situations, there is never a situation where you should only use one approach to it as there is nothing  in the game that does not have a counter of some type.
